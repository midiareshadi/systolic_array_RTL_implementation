## Testbench input data generator
Both the Verilog and SystemC testbenches utilized input files in text (.txt) format to operate. These text files were generated by two Python programs specifically designed to create both dense and sparse input matrices.

### Sparse matrix generator
To generate the [sparse matrix](https://github.com/midiareshadi/systolic_array_RTL_implementation/tree/main/testbench_File_Gen/sparse_generator) run the following command: 
  ```python3 sparse_tb_gen```
