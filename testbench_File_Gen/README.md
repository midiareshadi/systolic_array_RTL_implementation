## Testbench input data generator
Both the Verilog and SystemC testbenches utilized input files in text (.txt) format to operate. These text files were generated by two Python programs specifically designed to create both dense and sparse input matrices.

### Sparse matrix generator
To generate the [sparse matrix](https://github.com/midiareshadi/systolic_array_RTL_implementation/tree/main/testbench_File_Gen/sparse_generator) run the following command:

  ```python3 sparse_tb_gen.py```

We can define the density matrix and dimensions of a systolic array in a [JSON file](https://github.com/midiareshadi/systolic_array_RTL_implementation/blob/main/testbench_File_Gen/sparse_generator/input_values.json). Setting "heatmap_generation" to "True" in JSON file will generate the matrix heatmap and saves it as a PNG file.

### Results folder
Results are stored in three folders. `MatHeatMap`, `Reg_Format`, and `TB_Format`. These folders include:

```
MatHeatMap: Heapmap files
Reg_Format: Matrix in a regular format
TB_Format: Matrix in testbench format.
```

### Dense matrix generator
 In the [dense matrix](https://github.com/midiareshadi/systolic_array_RTL_implementation/tree/main/testbench_File_Gen/dense_mat_gen) generator, the input values are defined in command line parameters. For example:

 ```python3 dense_matrix_TB.py -rows 8 -cols 8```

 generates 8x8 input matrices.
