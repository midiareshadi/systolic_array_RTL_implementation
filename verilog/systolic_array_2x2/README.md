## Building and Running the Verilog code
To build code, use the following command:
```
iverilog *.v
```
It generates the a.out executable file, which can be run by:
```
./a.out
```
## Running code in EDA playground
The source code is also available on an EDA playground, which provides a platform to compile and execute the code directly in your web browser.
